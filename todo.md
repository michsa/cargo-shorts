### Pocket settings

| Task | Difficulty | Importance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fix the color picker palette (or change it to an analog picker) | ★★ | ☆☆☆ |

| add back the randomized initial emojis (or, pair emojis with the random initial descriptions) | ★★ | ☆☆ |
| create & add a guide image (notes & arrows) to show to first-time users | ★★★ | ☆☆ |

| fix dnd scroll problems with board layout | ★★★★ | ☆☆☆ |
| style the options button properly | ★ | ☆☆ |
