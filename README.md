# Cargo Shorts

Do you have Too Many Tabs open? Have you started maintaining multiple open browser windows just to get a handle on *All Those Dang Tabs??* 

Your friends shake their heads in disgust and mutter "That's what bookmarks are for, you dingus" – why can't they understand that your bookmarks are *a black hole into which all promising links vanish*, never to be seen again?

Cast off your despair, citizen, because the **Cargo Shorts**  browser extension exists *specifically* to solve all of your problems!

**Cargo Shorts** fills the void between the "Hundreds of Open Tabs" and "Sad Bookmark Graveyard" extremes of browser tab management. Just like a *real* pair of cargo shorts, it provides an endless number of pockets crafted specifically for holding an endless number of bookmark-esque links, along with the *Most Convenient Interface Possible* with which to manage them.

Create as many pockets as your heart desires! Deck them out with custom colors and (emoji) icons so you can tell them apart! Name them like children, and delete them forever when you don't want them anymore!

**Cargo Shorts** is so *free & libre* it'll make your gums bleed. (Source code is available [here](https://github.com/michsa/cargo-shorts).) I don't put up with ads or trackers on stuff I use, and I don't think you should have to, either.

Here are the permissions **Cargo Shorts** asks for, and why:

- [**`activeTab`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#activeTab_permission) – required in order to get the URL, title, and favicon for the current tab. Note that this permission *does* allow extensions to inject scripts into the current tab, but **Cargo Shorts** *does not and will never* use it for that purpose.

- [**`storage`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage) – required to persist the contents of your **Cargo Shorts**.

That's it! Please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:contact+cargo-shorts@michsa.me) with any questions, comments, issues, concerns, fan letters, or job offers you might have. I hope you enjoy my work!
