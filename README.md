# Cargo Shorts

Do you have Too Many Tabs open? Have you started maintaining multiple open browser windows just to get a handle on *All Those Dang Tabs?*

Your friends shake their heads in disgust and mutter "That's what bookmarks are for, you dingus" ‚Äì why can't they understand that your bookmarks are *a black hole into which all promising links vanish*, never to be seen again?

Cast off your despair, citizen, because the **Cargo Shorts**  browser extension exists *specifically* to solve all of your problems!

## ü§∑ What's it for?

**Cargo Shorts** fills the void between the "Hundreds of Open Tabs" and "Sad Bookmark Graveyard" extremes of browser tab management. Just like a *real* pair of cargo shorts, it provides an endless number of pockets crafted specifically for holding an endless number of bookmark-esque links, along with the *Most Convenient Interface Possible* with which to manage them.

## üíÅ How's it work?

Create as many pockets as your heart desires! Deck them out with custom colors üé® and icons ‚ú® so you can tell them apart! Name them like children üë∂, and delete them forever when you don't want them anymore!

Click on a pocket in the **Cargo Shorts** popup to add a link to the current page! Open a new tab to see all your pockets and links! That's literally it!

(By default, **Cargo Shorts** takes over your New Tab page to display the contents of your pockets. If you like your New Tab page the way it is, you can change this in the settings.)

## üëª Permissions & privacy, license, credits

**Cargo Shorts** is so *free & libre* it'll make your gums bleed. (MIT license; source is [here](https://github.com/michsa/cargo-shorts).) It uses *no* analytics, third-party scripts, or CDNs. I don't put up with ads or trackers on stuff I use, and I don't think you should have to, either.

Here are the permissions **Cargo Shorts** asks for, and why:

- [**`activeTab`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#activeTab_permission) ‚Äì required in order to get the URL, title, and favicon for the current tab. Note that this permission *does* allow extensions to inject scripts into the current tab, but **Cargo Shorts** *does not and will never* use it for that purpose.

- [**`storage`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage) ‚Äì required to persist the contents of your **Cargo Shorts**.

The [**Cargo Shorts** icon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/short_956766#term=shorts&page=1&position=23) was designed by [Kiranshastry](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/kiranshastry) from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), and is available for free with attribution.
